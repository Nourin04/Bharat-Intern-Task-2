# Movie Recommendation System

Key steps in the project included:

1. *Selecting Relevant Features* for generating recommendations.
2. *Replacing Null Values* with a null string to maintain data integrity.
3. *Combining All Selected Features* to create a comprehensive data set for analysis.
4. *Converting Text Data to Feature Vectors* using TfidfVectorizer.
5. *Calculating Similarity Scores* using Cosine Similarity to find movies that are alike.
6. *User Input*: Gathering the movie name from the user.
7. *Creating a Movie List*: Compiling all movie names from the dataset.
8. *Finding the Closest Match* for the user-provided movie name.
9. *Generating Similar Movie List*: Sorting movies based on their similarity score.
10. *Displaying Recommendations*: Presenting the names of similar movies based on their index.

Using libraries like *Numpy, **Pandas, **Difflib, **TfidfVectorizer, and **Cosine Similarity*, I was able to develop a robust system that provides relevant movie recommendations with ease. This project not only sharpened my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of recommendation algorithms.
